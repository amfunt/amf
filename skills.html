                        Throughout my academic years, I've encountered and used the above programming/webdev languages. 
                        We only mostly dabbled with each of them, but I think the curriculum wanted to enforce us with the familiarity with many programming languages. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Aside from developing my technical skills, the pandemic taught me about collaborating with other people when there are groupworks--all online, 
                        and teaching myself how to learn more efficiently since some professors ghosted us and literally left us to ourselves to learn about their subject course curriculum.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        What I have noticed that I enjoy the most while doing all my academic projects 
                        is that I enjoy debugging other people's outputs: testing each functionality if they work well,
                        and if they don't, I also enjoy fixing the bugs. Although I can write codes, I am not confident with how well
                        I can write codes from scratch, though I have no problems understanding and analyzing existing codes, and as mentioned above, I enjoy doing it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When I'm not doing any programming thing, I like spending my leisure time binge watching K-Drama, Series, Anime, BL, you name it.
                        I used to also constantly read novels but honestly, I just am not in the right headspace to do it lately, but I'll surely go back to it soon.
                        And as mentioned at the Homepage, I also enjoy listening to music. Whatever I'm doing, just know that I always have my Spotify playing in the background.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                    </p>
